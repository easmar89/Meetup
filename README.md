## MeetUp

An application where you can see events happening around you, both live and online. Each event displays date, time, location and a small description. You can read more about the event, discuss the event in comments and inform the organizer that you are attending and even change your mind if need so. You can search for the event you want with keywords and filter available ones by live/online. A new event can be created, and this newly created event can be edited or deleted as long as we did not reach the actual date of the event.
This application is developed with **React** and **Typescript** and tested with **React testing library**.
